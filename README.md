Notakto is a tic-tac-toe variant, also known as neutral or impartial tic-tac-toe.The game is a combination of the games tic-tac-toe and Nim,played across one or several boards with both of the players playing the same piece (an "X" or cross). The game ends when all the boards contain a three-in-a-row of Xs,[4][5] at which point the player to have made the last move loses the game. However, in this game, unlike tic-tac-toe, there will always be a player who wins any game of Notakto

Play
Notakto is played on a finite number of empty 3-by-3 boards. Then, each player takes turns placing an X on the board(s) in a vacant space (a space not occupied by a X already on the board).If a board has a three-in-a-row, the board is dead and it cannot be played on anymore. When one player creates a three-in-a-row and there are no more boards to play on, that player loses.
